## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about building intelligent, scalable systems across domains — from AI research and computer vision to data-driven automation and applied ML.  
Currently pursuing my **MS in Data Science at Northeastern University (GPA: 3.92)**, I focus on turning complex datasets into production-ready insights and solutions.

I’ve worked on projects spanning **ML model fine-tuning**, **real-time inference systems**, and **cloud-deployed automation pipelines** that dramatically reduced runtime, improved prediction accuracy, and enabled scalable experimentation.
